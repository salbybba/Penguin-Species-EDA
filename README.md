# Penguin Species Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores physical and categorical characteristics of penguin species to identify patterns related to species classification, sex differences, and island distribution. The goal was to apply exploratory data analysis and statistical testing to uncover meaningful relationships in ecological data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains measurements of penguins from three species, including culmen length and depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and island location. The data was cleaned to address missing values and ensure consistency across features.

## Methods
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and visualization libraries.
- Visualized relationships between physical traits using boxplots and scatterplots.
- Performed statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests) to evaluate differences in body mass by sex.
- Examined feature relevance for species differentiation.

## Results
- Clear physical differences were observed across penguin species.
- Statistical testing revealed significant body mass differences between male and female penguins.
- Culmen measurements emerged as strong indicators for distinguishing between species.

## Key Takeaways
- Exploratory data analysis is essential for understanding real-world datasets before modeling.
- Combining visualization with statistical testing leads to stronger, more reliable insights.
- Physical measurements can serve as effective predictors in species classification tasks.

## Tools Used
Python, pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, SciPy, Matplotlib
